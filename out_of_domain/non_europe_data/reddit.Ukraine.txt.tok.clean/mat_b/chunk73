  i have two :, 
  oas / 3rdeye / smallbore / counterbalance, 
  oes / 3rdeye / smallbore / hidden hand, 
  after spending a lot of time with the hidden hand one today , i think i preferer it with oas/counterbalance . 
  two things from my play : hidden hand is overrated and i question how much % boost i 'm getting over the base-50 stat both have . 
  the next is that while cb gives it maybe more stability it does n't need ... it makes it a dead-on laser that i know will hit every time exactly where i want it . 
  this plays a huge role in range , because i know the spread will always be 3 shots in a dead on vertical line . 
  the greater the spread and greater the horizontal direction , the more they drive apart when it comes to range , and that equals shots missed in the burst . 
  i dunno , i 'm going to continue to test and go back and forth , but damn i love my counterbalance . 
  if i give up on the hidden hand , i may try rolling for it . 
  i 'd like to get one of my other middle perks to be high caliber rounds . 
  think they make a difference ? 
  i 'm also enjoying single point sling , sometimes i 'll switch off smallbore for it on close quarters maps so i can strafe better , and with third eye , i 'm already going to be ads most of the time . 
  i 'll give it a whirl , i 'd love for it to be as good as my hopscotch, 
  mostly so i can run it in trials and get thorn users depressed they got wrecked by a f 'n spare change, 
  i use counterbalance on my hopscotch so i 'm already kinda in < 3 with it as a 3rd perk, 
  blame it on the vex, 
  it is good but i just really like having the bullets not deviate at all from the reticle , especially at range, 
  did it once , got my last elder cipher, 
  if it was just the fight i 'd do it again , but dont feel like putting in the 1hr commitment for the whole level 35 to not get any loot i need, 
  i still run vog because it 's fun the whole way through and it 's 6-man , plus there 's still some guns that have yet to drop for me, 
  i still do crota because it 's basically a strike , and i 'm hoping for a good pvp helm to drop, 
  it 's all ogre now . 
  i say that line every time i do the mars strike, 
  i doubt it , mines count for oracle burn , shanks should count for shanks damnit, 
  `` free '', 
  nothing is free, 
  we 're basically on a subscription right now anyway , but only $ 8 month, 
  was going to photoshop `` phogoth : on ice ! '', 
  but gave up, 
  i maxed it out yesterday . 
  it still goes to the left , but slightly . 
  you notice it if you spam the trigger while shooting a wall and notice it slightly drift with each pulse . 
  it 's very manageable in pvp though since you wo n't be shooting stationary targets and ignoring the right thumb stick . 
  actually did well with it , probably going to be in my regular rotation now . 
  id prefer if they actually changed things up every time it comes through, 
  majestic as fuck, 
  is there a lot of lag or at least latency that would make it worthless for pvp play ? 
  thanks , was wondering how bad the latency was, 
  i 'm guessing no since it would bypass the xbox output and stream it to the pc , so the pc would have to be out to the headphone amp , not the xbox, 
  i 'm only asking about wired gigabit ethernet, 
  where are they teaching eachother this crap ? 
  i mean ... where !? 
  essentially ` i 'm a stateless person but receive the benefits of us citizenship because i 'm a peaceful person '', 
  and that she claimed `` rape '' just made it icing . 
  i 'm using plan c as my pvp exotic now . 
  i needed something to quickly rip off to defend against charging shotguns , and so far so good . 
  which i think rest on using it for its exotic purpose : luring people into close-med range and getting an instant 1 hit kill off when they think they have you on the ropes, 
  i thought there was a cooldown to prevent you from doing this ? 
  and yeah , i was doing this with quickdraw last night, 
  i got rid of my outlaw/headseeker yesterday in favor of third eye/hidden hand, 
  im still not sure where to slot it in . 
  oversoul edict is full auto with nearly but not as much aim assist and stability . 
  timepiece is best in this regard . 
  im leaving timepiece to be the one with headseeker , and i guess i 'll eventually have to decide whether third eye , headseeker , or full auto is the best perk for this kind of gun, 
  that said , i was absolutely [ melting ] ( http://destinytracker.com/destiny/games/1/4611686018433242693/2305843009224049274/3129471041?page=0 ) fools with the timepiece last night ( just got it monday ) . 
  i dont think its something you rely on , but something that helps you a lot, 
  my problem with knucklehead is that its pure strength , i 'd rather have an exotic that will give me a good int/dsc roll and help out in a way that a weapon perk cant, 
  well , someone 's got ta get it, 
  normally a body ( 78 ) and headshot ( 114 ) is 192 damage . 
  with headseeker it 's 201 damage . 
  personally i think it 's situational , that you 'd have to both run into a guy with over 192 health , and have to hit the body first before the headshot . 
  i left headseeker to my messenger since i much prefer the `` laser '' effect of counterbalance and am hitting more long range headshots as a result . 
  you ca n't bin ban the rahool man, 
  i agree , double the nerf, 
  n\u00d6\u00d6\u00d6\u00d6\u00d6\u00d6\u00d6\u00d6\u00d6\u00d6\u00d6\u00d6\u00d6\u00d6\u00d6\u00d6\u00d6\u00d6\u00d6\u00d6 !, 
  mayhem mode in ttk is going to suck so hard, 
  googling forums and seeing one guy say 6 seconds , another 15 , i have no clue, 
  i was trying to do it on patrol and couldnt seem to get a set time in there, 
  this is why i love combined arms , these maps are great and also have zero thorn/shotgun idiocy, 
  i like it , but who cares about an emblem nobody will use come october ? 
  this concerns me . 
  there 's no way bungie mass-bans with a 100 % accuracy rate, 
  i already made this thread and music mix damnit, 
  meanwhile for me , none of my dell computers in my office that i want to upgrade are doing so without an activation key , and the one i tested on ( junker in the back ) did so no problem . 
  then my home pc also asks for a key , or errors during installation , depending on the method i use . 
  this is really pathetic on ms 's part . 
  in lieu of no appeals process and how secretive they are keeping it , a weekly update that shows their process might be helpful . 
  unless they do n't want the smart cheaters to know their methods to bypass them ... 
  1st link has vlc error , 3rd forwards to another site, 
  hey now , nobody 's perfect, 
  also likely . 
  but is network manipulation on the criteria you 're talking about the only thing they are banning on ? 
  or are there other factors ? 
  surely there are some false positives out there, 
  fair enough, 
  because the game looks like ass and they wanted to make it even more cringeworthy, 
  so i got my feeding frenzy / braced frame / reactive reload setup going now, 
  24 headshots turn into 31 , assuming all bullets connect that 's really a 72 hs turning into a 93 hs . 
  it 's still a 3sk no matter how you slice it . 
  below is with all rounds in a burst landing , dmg in brackets . 
  ** normally : **, 
  3 | 1 bodyshot 2 headshots ( 192 ), 
  4 | 2 body 2 head ( 240 ), 
  3 headshots ( 216 ), 
  ** reactive reload : **, 
  3 | 2 body 1 head ( 219 ), 
  3 | 1 body 2 head ( 249 ), 
  3 | 3 head ( 279 ), 
   are you trying to clean install or upgrade ?
