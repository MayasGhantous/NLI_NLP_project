  i have read the documents . 
  but remember , those are dated . 
  all we know is that ttk was a $ 40 sequel and there will be a ( presumably ) larger sequel next september likely for $ 60 . 
  im sick of having 5 people who want to play , but 3 of us have to go in , find a random , send them an invite and tell them to friend and invite my other 2 friends, 
  jesus just allow 6 man patrol fireteams, 
  i thought heroics had better rewards ? 
  mmo sequels are expansions . 
  nope . 
  ffs it 's like you pundits do n't even read, 
   dague also expressed ** the studio 's plans about progress carrying over to an eventual destiny sequel ** , noting that the studio intends to allow it and recognizes the attachment players form with their guardians . 
   `` the idea is that the guardian you have created is something you can bring along with you on that adventure . 
  if you take a look at the way people have played other games for a long period of time , they 've had a relationship with the same character for a very long time . '', 
  same shit , quit being pedantic . 
  yes , i was sick of getting doubles , triples of the same damn exotics, 
  bungie needs to fix their algo on this, 
  for me majority were duplicates . 
  like 3 dont touch me 's , 2 telesto , 2 suros , 2 zhalo , 2 knuckleheads , 2 4 horsemen , 2 last words , etc, 
  i dont know why you think that because they ported it to 360 , that the engine is somehow limited or dated . 
  there are a lot of games built on top notch engines , destiny included , that put out last-gen versions . 
  and i guess we could look at the wow example again , where specs change through the years but it 's the same base game . 
  but they should , i mean , they keep yammering on about how the rng is smart and knows what you have , so you 'll get gear that matters, 
  what time ? 
   `` the flower eater , the queen of final shapes , that which also inhabits its petitioners '', 
  final shapes sounds like hive, 
   [ the hive ] scoured them away and left the universe clean , ready to move towards its final shape . 
  they are driven to make the universe its final shape , and we know they are inhabited by the worms, 
  i call him nolantron and will continue to do so, 
  damn , i was really hoping the vendor stock would re-roll every week : /, 
  i did 1-2 but was involved in maybe 20 , the court is a marvellous place . 
  so they fixed it , when are the mods going to lift this ban ? 
  says they fixed it . 
  problem solved . 
  depends on your overall light level . 
  if you 're above the recommended light level with a y1 170 on , you 're golden . 
  hm , i found during vanguard strikes yesterday whether light 275 or 293 , i did the same primary damage ( the former being when i 'd equip a 170 in my heavy slot ), 
  i grinded my ass off to get to 290 for friday and in the end i could n't get a single group together to do the damn raid . 
  we started but never got to the first boss , and the other groups that invited me were already at the end . 
  what a shitty fucking week . 
  and i blame bungie for starting this shit at 1pm on a week day . 
  a 10-30 minute cooldown would be better, 
  also , they do n't stack . 
  they have a 1/5 chance of dropping so its conceivable that out of 5 you just had a bad roll and needed 1 more . 
  i found that not to be the case after going through 120 of them, 
  and i took him out with an auto rifle, 
  here 's my take and it revolves around this one line, 
   the dragons . 
  our gods should be ours alone . 
  their smug freedom is an insult to me . 
  i 'd shut them all in cells . 
  bring them to me !, 
  the dragons also either worship the worm ( wyrm ? ), 
  gods , or can connect to the deep ( darkness ) without them . 
  talking with the `` oh mine '' is a side effect of the deep , kind of like gollum saying `` my precious '' . 
  that , or the worm gods are ahamkara that are hosts to / infected by the worms . 
  the hive use the worms to channel the darkness and have their power and immortality , but the ahamkara can do it without them . 
  as a result , they are ` free ' while the hive are hosts and enslaved to their power . 
  this , or if they are infected , are why oryx does n't like that other species can worship dragons ( their gods ) freely and uninfected . 
  op , you 're confusing the worms ( the hive ) and the worm gods , the giant creatures with immeasurable powers found at the bottom of the sea of fundament . 
  is it possible that the 3 worm gods are infected ahamkara ? 
  this would explain their size . 
  all worms need a host , and this would explain why there are 3 worm gods and just small worms beneath them . 
  it would also explain why the worm talked like an ahamkara , and not the other way around . 
  i think you 're close . 
  the worm gods are infected ahamkara who are hosts to the hive ( the worms ) . 
  they are worm gods , not worms themselves . 
  gods that have been infected by worms . 
  how about this : wyrm gods infected by worms . 
  * mind blown *, 
  now let 's connect the ahamkara to akka, 
   it was not an easy decision . 
  power had been obtained from the bargains , and the city needed power . 
  knowledge had been gleaned , and ** the ahamkara knew answers to questions no one had known to ask . 
  and, 
   he walked until he found ** akka , the worm of secrets , who was denying a truth until it became a lie ** . 
  `` akka my god , worm of secrets . 
  i am auryx , sole king of the hive . 
  i have come to receive a secret . 
  i want the secret power of the deep , which you hold . '', 
  so akka also holds secrets , truth , and knowledge , like the ahamkara . 
  also, 
   oryx scrimshawed one piece of akka , who was dead but far from gone . 
  oryx wears pieces of akka like we wear ahamkara bones . 
  which also live on after death . 
  and speak to you ... 
  they complain that you should n't confuse biological sex and `` gender '', 
  then applies the female gender to the bees because they are biologically female . 
  i dont think this means the free dragons worship the worm gods , but that they channel the darkness as they do , free from being worm hosts . 
  i think the key part here is that they are free and smug , while oryx and the hive are bound to the worms or they will die . 
  and by this point oryx is a god , he slew akka like it was nothing . 
  he may not be talking about the right to worship the ` worm gods ' but rather the right to channel the deep . 
  i think it 's both or either that we are dead and not able to be taken . 
  and also because if you read the grimoire , being taken is literally being consumed by the darkness . 
  we are already consumed by the light . 
  ` taken ' are the dark equivalent to guardians . 
  technically oryx has died a million times . 
  he goes back to this throne realm and resurrects , like how we are resurrected . 
  we 're both dead and immortal . 
  they can die . 
  oryx and the ascendant ca n't , not without special means . 
  but guardians can die , look at eris ' team .
