  they literally impose a race binary on them ( white vs non-white ) and perpetuate their own bullshit . 
  pretty sure on average men are taller than women . 
  so this must be the patriarchy they talk about .

  yeah , people need to remember that it likely wasnt designed to fight other lightsabre wielders, 
  so , is being from south carolina a disadvantage in life or ... ? 
  he 's yellow , so that makes him a poc, 
  reading wookiepedia tells me that lightsabers were originally just for ceremonial purposes , so double the `` not designed for deuling '' aspect, 
   dragonkin do n't eat real gemstones/valuable metals . 
  i 'm out . 
  i had a friend in highschool who was half dutch half mexican , total racist, 
  funny guy, 
  pdx has better aa and the ability to get a 100 % stability roll, 
  every other day , but not on the sabbath, 
  when will bungie patch the cryptarch ? 
  he never gives out legendaries as package rewards anymore , and he does n't drop the emblems or shaders that are in the kiosk as rewards . 
  shit is totally not working right . 
  my username is mister rahool . 
  i need the damn emblem . 
  so so bad . 
  i guess they 'd argue that the white world didnt care about rawanda, 
  worst raid ever was when everyone i got grouped with was smoking up , and on daughters this clown had to stop and meet with his drug dealer, 
  when he got back he was higher than ever, 
  and yeah , he sucked, 
   smoking by no means really inhibits your ability to play . 
   alcohol on the other hand has a massive influence because its much easier to get too drunk than too stoned . 
  this is great, 
  it 's happening !, 
  secret racist ? 
  nothing is backwards , not even racism . 
  this is tumblrinaction , i expected the response to be someone decrying ` cultural appropriation ' for what he 's wearing, 
  it could be the plan was to get obi wan not so he could help with the war , but because only he knew where luke was . 
  and luke was the * new hope * . 
  was thrown into a lot of losing games in progress last night, 
  because biological gender is a social construct , how dare you ask , retrograde bitchass, 
   - trans people were n't born with the wrong body . 
  my body is n't wrong - society 's assumption of genitals = gender is what is wrong, 
   - some trans people think their bodies are wrong , and that 's also to be respected, 
  what, 
   - trans people were n't born with the wrong body . 
  my body is n't wrong - society 's assumption of genitals = gender is what is wrong, 
  - some trans people think their bodies are wrong , and that 's also to be respected, 
  what . 
  transtrender, 
  omg i 'm using that, 
  they opted in six months ago, 
  a trans poc is killed every 29 minutes , educate yourself , shitlord, 
  ftm and `` gay '' but definitely in the `` it 's just a phase / for the attention '' category along with all the other adherence to literally everything sjw we find on here . 
  which makes for good quotes and screencaps for tumblrinaction, 
  ( oh shit , xir post got 450 shares so far , shits trending ), 
  oh do n't worry i do n't . 
  have you checked your privilege ? 
  good poast, 
  haha, 
  repoast , needed to scrub some personal info off, 
  weapons do matter , i went to a y1 pulse rifle at 170 and it took several more shots to kill someone than needed, 
  yes i 've smoked / smoke . 
  that 's how i know . 
  there 's a reason you get a dui for smoking while driving , because it inhibits your motor skills . 
  the second is just bull nonsense from you , so i 'll just assume you 're too young to understand . 
  you can get blackout drunk , you can get so baked that you pass out . 
  it 's not `` easy '' to die from alcohol poisoning , have you ever drank before ? 
  lol, 
  but to say it 's easier to over drink than over smoke is just , total , bullshit . 
  people can drink all night and be fine , people can have half a joint and be roasted . 
  to say you speak for everyone 's tolerances just makes you sound like a jackass . 
  holy shit you 're stupid . 
   * smoking by no means really inhibits your ability, 
   * that is it , so yes when you smoke , you are under an influence . 
  do you even read what you write , or do you just freestyle and hope for the best ? 
   `` on average , 6 people died every day from alcohol poisoning in the us from 2010 to 2012 . '', 
  you realize that 's infinitely small , right ? 
  you could say the same thing about [ tylenol ] ( http://www.drugwatch.com/tylenol/ ) . 
  just because something can happen , does n't make it easy . 
  people are n't going to bars and dropping dead . 
  beer is not cocaine . 
  your argument is nothing more than stoner logic . 
   y logic by saying i 'm just a dumb stoner , but my stoner logic was just backed by science ... sooooo ... 
  lol , no it is n't , you 've proven literally nothing so far . 
  are you stoned ? 
  you 're trying so hard , grasping at straws with these fringe examples to prove , literally , the dumbest comment i 've seen on reddit all week . 
  good job . 
  if your argument is that pot does n't impair you at all , you 're fucking stupid . 
  you ca n't even try to back that stoney statement up . 
   that the words inhibit and influence are close ? 
  thanks for the english lesson ... 
  so glib . 
  you give some sob story about people dying from drunk driving , and pretend driving high and getting duis there are unrelated . 
  lol . 
  there are people on here i will actively engage and argue with , but no , not you , your high as fuck trolling is n't going to get that kind of attention , you lost already . 
   you sir are retarded . 
  you are arguing with no logic or evidence to back your stance . 
  ** i have provided multiple sources of legitimate credibility ** and you have provided me with your `` opinion '' . 
  no , you have n't , go back to getting stoned . 
   please tell me where i said , `` pot does n't impair you at all '' what i said was , `` it does n't inhibit your ability, 
  so you 're saying it impairs you but does n't inhibit your ability ? 
  re-read that , champ . 
   i 'm providing sources for my argument, 
  no you are n't .
